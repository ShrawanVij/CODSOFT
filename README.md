# CODSOFT Internship May 2024 batch A54🧑‍💻
>Welcome to my CodSoft Internship September 2023 demo with CODSOFT.
In this repository, I present my three significant tasks that I accomplished during my internship:
## Task 1: MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION🎬
>In this task I created a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. I used techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifier such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression.

## Task 2: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION💳
>In this task I build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use adataset containing information about credit card transactions, andexperiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent orlegitimate.

## Task 3: SPAM SMS DETECTION📪
>In this task I build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam orlegitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support VectorMachines to identify spam messages for better user experience.
